2. Compile & run the java file inside /src.

## Usage
1. To perform any double operand operation, users have to enter one operand then the operation then another operand then the equal button.
	e.g. 1 + 2 =

## Technical Description
Calculators functionality is defined in the `Engine` class. 
`ActionServer` is handling button click event. 
`ElementContainer` class bind all calculator visual element together. 
`ButtonHolder` create all required buttons those are being used by `ElementContainer`

## Limitation
1. This calculator is not able to evaluate any mathematical expression.
2. Due to, the limitation of value container(e.g. variable) this can't work with very large number(more than 32 bits or 64 bits).
3. Digit limitation is 15 digit.
